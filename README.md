This project aims to implement several algorithms and  useful tools, including linear and logistic regression, non-linear features, regularization, and kernel tricks. It bridges the gap between usage of these tools to Real World Problems, in this case Digit Recognition Problem with MNIST Dataset.This Project Is part of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MITx 6.86x.
